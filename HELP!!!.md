**The requirement**

The Business needs a large and growing data warehouse to
store sensitive customer and transaction information.

We've asked S. S. Steve to implement this.

He provided us the following terraform.

**Help us peer review his submission.**

Does it meet the requirements? What other ways could he have achieved this?

Does it meet terraform and general devops best practices?

What would you do differently to make it more robust,
easier to maintain, and easier to understand for the next
SRE that needs to modify it?

Is there anything about it you think is good?

_Should Steve get paid?!_
